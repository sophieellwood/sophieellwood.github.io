I am a second-year Master's student at McGill University and [**MILA**](https://mila.quebec/en) in Montreal, Canada, under the supervision of Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi in the [**Shape Analysis Group**](https://cim.mcgill.ca/~shape/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at Queen’s University in Kingston, where I did my final-year thesis under the supervision of Dr. Ting Hu in the [**Machine Intelligence & Biocomputing (MIB) Lab**](https://sites.google.com/site/tinghushomepage).

My current research focus is on machine learning for 3D geometry processing.
