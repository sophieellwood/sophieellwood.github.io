Kartt is a chrome extension, launched as a part of [Queen’s Tech and Media Association](https://www.qtma.ca/) (Canada’s premier product development club). Our team built Kartt over an 8 month period, spanning product ideation, market research and development. Kartt helps online shoppers by automatically displaying the true total cost of products, including shipping and taxes, directly as they browse.
Kartt was built using AWS infrastructure including EC2 and Lambda, and was the Winner of QTMA’s Winter Demo 2023 Day.
